In this blog post, we will be going over two important interactions with Artificial intelligence (AI):

1. **Zero Trust and AI** – navigating the balance between empowering employees to leverage AI services and safeguarding against potential information leaks and misuse.

2. **Developers and AI** – exploring the simplicity behind building, training, inferring, and optimizing AI applications.

## Zero Trust and AI

### Measuring Usage

> _**Shadow IT Discovery** provides visibility into the SaaS applications and private network origins your end users are visiting._

By implementing **[Cloudflare Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/)**, and hence **[Shadow IT](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/analytics/access/)**, IT departments can review AI usage, helping in budgeting and policy-making decisions, as well as the ability to block AI services if needed.

### Controlling API Access

> _**Cloudflare Access** determines who can reach your application by applying the Access policies you configure._

Developers can use **[Service Tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/service-tokens/)** on **[Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/)** Policies for secure API access control, allowing teams to share training data securely, or granting plug-in access for an AI service, enforcing authentication on each and every request made.

### Restricting Data Uploads

> _**Cloudflare Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** allows you to scan your web traffic and SaaS applications for the presence of sensitive data such as social security numbers, financial information, secret keys, and source code._

Human involvement always has the potential for security incidents through oversharing. By implementing Cloudflare's **[Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/data-loss-prevention/)** with **[Gateway HTTP Policies](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/http-policies/)**, IT departments can define data parameters and establish detailed rules for sharing sensitive information with AI services, essentially preventing information leaks.

#### Restrict Interactions with AI

Additionally, with Cloudflare's **[Remote Browser Isolation (RBI)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/browser-isolation/)** one can transparently disable different interactions with AI services, such as preventing copy / paste or upload / download.

### Controlling Use without a Proxy

> _**Cloudflare's API-driven Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)** scans SaaS applications for misconfigurations, unauthorized user activity, shadow IT, and other data security issues that can occur after a user has successfully logged in._

Potential misconfigurations in SaaS applications, like AI plug-ins having more access than one wants to, can be identified by Cloudflare's **[Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/scan-apps/)**, with upcoming integrations to check for misconfigurations in popular AI services.

## Developers and AI

> _Build and deploy ambitious AI applications to Cloudflare's global network_

Building full-stack AI applications is now easier and more accessible than ever. Explore a variety of [examples here](https://workers.cloudflare.com/built-with/collections/ai-workers/) to gain insights into the possibilities.

### Storing Training Data efficiently

Leverage **[R2 Object Storage](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)** for storing training data to reduce egress fees and maintain the flexibility required for multi-cloud architectures.

### Global and Fast Inference

Execute and deploy models seamlessly with **[Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/)**, harnessing the capabilities of recently [deployed GPUs worldwide](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/).

Additionally, efficiently store and retrieve embeddings using **[Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/)** to accelerate vector look-ups.

### Optimizing Scalability and Observability

Integrate your AI application with **[AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/)** for enhanced observability through analytics, along with controlled scalability featuring caching and granular rate limiting.
