While growing up I have always been a fan of Google â€“ you can find almost anything on there, as long as you are also kind of patient. Today, Google has tremendously improved its search algorithm and almost any one kind find anything on it.

Nonetheless, I believe that there are still people out there who do not know how to start their search, what exactly they are looking for, or simply don't even know that there is something out there that might make their lives/work a little easier/better.

That's essentially how the World of Opportunities idea came to life. It is a free resource platform for entrepreneurs and students who are eager to discover useful links, gain access to resources, tools and opportunities to reach their goals.

As a fellow very curious individual, here I present to you a small (kind of curated list) of resources and more --> [World of Opportunities](/projects/world-of-opportunities/)
