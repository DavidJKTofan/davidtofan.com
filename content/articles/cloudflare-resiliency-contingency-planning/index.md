Enterprise customers – particularly in public sector, finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure – increasingly face regulatory or governance requirements demanding documented vendor contingency strategies. This is not about distrust of Cloudflare's resilience; it's about demonstrating due diligence and risk management to auditors, boards, and compliance bodies.

## When Contingency Planning Actually Matters

### Regulatory Drivers

- **Financial Services**: Central Banks or Governments usually mandate operational resilience frameworks with vendor concentration risk assessments.
- **Public Sector**: often reference sovereignty controls, documented exit capabilities.
- **Critical Infrastructure**: [Network and Information Security Directive 2.0 (NIS2)](https://www.cloudflare.com/build-your-nis2-compliance-strategy/) mentions having robust redundancy measures in place for critical systems.
- **Healthcare**: US HIPAA business associate agreements and other data residency requirements usually drive contingency planning for protected health information (PHI) systems.

### Reality Check

Despite these drivers, security / operational cost of parallel infrastructure often exceeds vendor dependency risk. Most organizations are better served by:

- Maximizing Cloudflare's native resilience features.
- Maintaining strong Cloudflare Enterprise account team or [Partner](https://www.cloudflare.com/partners/) relationships.
- Accepting brief degradation preferable to exposing unprotected origins.
- Investing in origin resilience and disaster recovery.

## Cloudflare's Standard Architecture Is Already Resilient

Cloudflare separates its **[Control Plane](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-the-control-plane/)** (management / [API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/) / Dashboard) from its **Data Plane** ([traffic flow](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/traffic-flow-cloudflare/) / Edge), ensuring traffic continues to flow even if the management dashboard is unavailable. Cloudflare's global anycast [network](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) is architected for resilience – every server in every data center shares the same tech stack and announces IP addresses via [anycast](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/), providing inherent redundancy.

Before discussing contingency strategies, recognize that a properly configured Cloudflare deployment already provides exceptional resilience:

- [Anycast](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/) routing: Traffic automatically routes to the nearest healthy data center.

- N+x redundancy: Multiple servers ([Multi-Colo-PoPs](https://blog.cloudflare.com/meet-traffic-manager/)) in each location provide failover without manual intervention.

- Control / Data Plane separation: Existing configurations continue operating even during control plane degradation.

- Load Balancing with health checks: [Automatic origin failover](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/round-robin-dns/) within Cloudflare.

- Serverless Runtime [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/how-workers-works/) for custom failover logic: Write programmable traffic routing based on [origin health](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/examples/modify-response/), retries, timeouts, and circuit breakers for dependencies for [storage options](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/storage-options/).

- Geographic distribution and [backbone](https://blog.cloudflare.com/backbone2024/): 13,000+ network interconnects with major ISPs and cloud providers.

Most availability requirements are met through proper Cloudflare configuration – using Load Balancing, health checks, traffic steering, and multiple origins – rather than multi-vendor complexity.

While Cloudflare strives for maximum [resilience](https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/) – constantly improving through learning and innovation – some customers require documented contingency ("break glass") strategies to meet risk compliance, regulatory, or sovereignty requirements. This document provides a non-exhaustive high-level introduction to architectural patterns for designing failover capabilities while maintaining security posture.

> **The goal is not to offboard from Cloudflare, but to provide a potential safety net (backup plan) that allows customers to rely on the platform with confidence.**

## Critical Self-Risk Assessment

Before activating any bypass strategy or failover plan, organizations must answer:

> **At what point does the security risk of exposing infrastructure outweigh the downtime of waiting for service restoration?**

Considerations:

- **Loss of WAF / DDoS protection**: Disabling Cloudflare [exposes origin IPs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/security/protect-your-origin-server/) directly to the Internet.
- **Integration breakage**: Third-party scripts and integrations, Workers, Load Balancing logic, and SaaS integrations may fail – if they are also using Cloudflare.
- **Attack surface exposure**: Malicious actors monitor DNS changes; bypassing protections during outages creates potential exploitation windows.
- **Operational cost**: Maintaining parallel infrastructure, training staff on multiple platforms, and designing applications for vendor-agnostic operation requires significant investment, time and additional resources.
- **Configuration drift**: Multi-vendor setups introduce complexity in maintaining policy parity, certificate management, and configuration coordination.

For most organizations, the answer is: **wait for service restoration**. The cost of maintaining bypass / a backup infrastructure, the security risk of exposure, and the complexity of [multi-vendor](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/architectures/multi-vendor/) operations exceeds the cost of brief service degradation.

> Before implementing multi-vendor strategies, exhaust Cloudflare's native resilience capabilities.

## Part 1: Application Services (Reverse Proxy / CDN / WAF)

The primary mechanism for circumventing [Cloudflare reverse proxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/) for application traffic relies on [DNS architecture](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/) and origin security.

### Architecture Components & Failover Steps

| Component             | Resiliency Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Failure Scenario Action ("Break glass")                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Management**        | Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Manage configurations via [API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/account-owned-tokens/) / [Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/) instead of Dashboard UI. Use [CI/CD](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/) pipelines.                                               | If Dashboard (Control Plane) is unavailable, API often remains operational. Use pipelines to rollback or push bypass configs.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Domain Registrar**  | **Decoupled Registrar**: Keep [Domain Registrar](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/) separate from Cloudflare.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Ultimate control point. Ensures capability to change [Nameserver (NS) records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/nameservers/) even if Cloudflare is entirely unreachable.                                                                                      |
| **DNS (CNAME Setup)** | Use external Authoritative DNS (Route53, Azure DNS) and CNAME specific subdomains to Cloudflare. Take into account [DNSSEC](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/dnssec-for-secondary/).                                                                                                                    | [Remove CNAME record](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/setup/#3-add-dns-records) pointing to `cdn.cloudflare.net` and replace with A/CNAME record pointing to origin or backup provider.                                             |
| **DNS (Full Setup)**  | Configure [Secondary DNS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/) provider with [zone transfers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/). Take into account [DNSSEC](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-primary/dnssec-for-primary/). | If Cloudflare nameservers are unresponsive, secondary provider answers queries. Requires zone synchronization.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Origin Security**   | **Publicly Trusted Certificates**: Ensure origins have valid, publicly trusted SSL/TLS certificates (not Cloudflare-issued Certificates only).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Critical: If disabling Cloudflare, origin (or backup provider) must terminate TLS directly without certificate errors. Using a [Custom Certificate](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/) can be advantageous in this case. |
| **Load Balancing**    | Configure [Cloudflare Load Balancing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/proxy-modes/) with health checks, multiple origins, and [traffic steering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/traffic-steering/).                                                                                      | Primary resilience mechanism: Cloudflare automatically fails over to healthy origins with [adaptive routing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/adaptive-routing/). Configure appropriate health check intervals and origin pools.  |
| **CDN/Proxy**         | [Multi-vendor architecture](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/architectures/multi-vendor/) (Primary-Fallback or Active-Active) for those who can afford operational complexity.                                                                                                                                                          | Route traffic to backup CDN / security provider via DNS steering. Note: Introduces configuration drift, cache management complexity, and certificate coordination overhead.                                                                                         |

### DNS Setup Options

![DNS Architecture Options](img/dns-setup-overview.png)

**Option 1: [CNAME (Partial) Setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/)**

- Use an external Authoritative DNS provider.
- [Proxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/) only specific hostnames via Cloudflare.
- Fastest failover: [remove CNAME](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/setup/#3-add-dns-records), point to origin/backup.
- [DNS TTL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/ttl/)-dependent propagation for change.

**Option 2: Secondary DNS with Override**

- Cloudflare as [Primary or Secondary](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/).
- Zone transfers maintain synchronization.
- [Secondary DNS Override](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/proxy-traffic/) enables proxying specific records.
- Provides DNS-level redundancy.

**Option 3: [Full Setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/) (Cloudflare Authoritative)**

- Weigh trade-off when [unproxying](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/#dns-only-records): exposed [origin IPs should be rotated](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/prevent-ddos-attacks/advanced/protect-origin-ip/#rotate-ip-addresses) post-incident.
- Consider accepting (unlikely) temporary unavailability vs. security exposure, in the unlikely event that Cloudflare suffers a serious incident.
- May be preferable to wait for restoration rather than expose infrastructure.

### Multi-Vendor Architecture Options

```

**Configuration Management**: Maintain parity via Terraform across providers. [API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/account-owned-tokens/)-first approach enables automated synchronization.

- **Active-Active (Recommended)**: Both vendors receive traffic continuously. Provides ongoing signal for security tools (i.e. Bot Management, Rate Limiting). Configuration complexity manageable if traffic split is maintained.

![Multi-Vendor Active-Active Architecture Example](img/visual-diagram-multi-vendor-active-active-architecture.png)

- **Active-Passive**: One vendor receives all traffic normally; backup only used during incidents. Higher cutover risk due to cold configuration and lack of baseline traffic for Machine Learning (ML)-based security features.

Operational Considerations:

- Cache purge and [security coordination](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/best-practices/third-party/) across vendors required.
- Certificate management complexity (same [Custom Certificates](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/) on both platforms).
- Log aggregation and normalization to common SIEM format.
- Configuration drift monitoring and automated reconciliation.
- Only really justified for extreme availability requirements or regulatory mandates.

## Part 2: SASE (Zero Trust) & Network Services

For Zero Trust ([WARP Device Client](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/warp/) / [Secure Web Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/)) and Network services ([Magic Transit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/)), contingency planning can be more complex as these services are deeply integrated into employee workflows and network infrastructure.

- **"Shadow VPN" Strategy**: Pre-deployed but dormant legacy VPN infrastructure (OpenVPN, etc.) that can be activated if Cloudflare Zero Trust becomes unavailable. Requires maintaining separate authentication, DNS, and network routing configurations.

## Practical Sample Action Plan for Cloudflare L7 Application Services

**Context and Scope**: This sample action plan assumes the outage affects Cloudflare Layer-7 (HTTP/HTTPS) reverse-proxy / application services. Mitigations differ for other Cloudflare products (Magic Transit, Spectrum, Zero Trust, etc.). The guidance below addresses immediate operational steps, risks, and configuration details for bypassing Cloudflare so traffic reaches origins directly.

### Immediate Checks (First 60–120 Seconds)

1. Confirm Cloudflare outage via [Cloudflare Status](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/) and public reports
2. Verify [Cloudflare API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/) accessibility (API responsiveness required for fast programmatic toggles)
3. Identify which [DNS records are proxied](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) (orange cloud / `proxied: true`) vs DNS-only
4. Verify origin public accessibility, capacity (CPU, connections, bandwidth, autoscaling status) and security (firewall)

### Fastest Mitigation (Not Recommended): Disable the Reverse Proxy (DNS Stays on Cloudflare)

**Action**: Set affected DNS records from `proxied` → `DNS only` (orange cloud → grey cloud).

**Effect**: Cloudflare continues serving DNS responses but no longer proxies or terminates TLS/HTTP; clients resolve names to origin IPs directly.

**How to Execute**:

**Via Dashboard**:

```
DNS → Select Record → Toggle Proxy Status → Save
```

**Via [API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/create-dns-records/#edit-dns-records)** (example for single record):

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{ZONE_ID}/dns_records/{RECORD_ID}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {API_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "type": "A",
    "name": "www.example.com",
    "content": "198.51.100.4",
    "ttl": 120,
    "comment": "Disabled due to XYZ – write a recognizable comment for auditing",
    "proxied": false
  }'
```

**Post-Change Verification**:

- Confirm `proxied: false` via `GET /zones/{zone_id}/dns_records` or `dig +short` to ensure responses are origin IPs
- Test origin responds to HTTP(S) directly; validate TLS handshake and application behavior
- Monitor origin resource utilization (CPU, memory, connections)

### Alternative When Cloudflare API is Unavailable: Change DNS to Point Directly to Origin

**If you operate external DNS** (or secondary DNS provider) with [CNAME setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/):

- Update DNS entries to point to origin host or origin IPs directly
- Replace CNAME target with origin A/AAAA record or CNAME to origin hostname

**Considerations**:

- If zone is Cloudflare authoritative DNS, switching to another provider requires NS record changes at registrar (not fast during outage – requires pre-planning)
- DNS [TTL](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/ttl/) matters: Long TTLs slow propagation. Use 60–300s TTLs in normal operation for faster failover
- Secondary DNS with [zone transfers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/) enables rapid failover if pre-configured

### TLS, Certificates and Ports

When traffic bypasses Cloudflare:

**Certificate Requirements**:

- Origin must present valid certificate accepted by clients
- Ensure origin has public CA certificate (not [Cloudflare Origin CA](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/) only)
- Clients will validate certificate directly; mismatched SANs or expired certs cause failures

**Protocol Support**:

- Verify origin supports SNI, ALPN, HTTP/2 if clients expect these
- Cloudflare supports [non-standard ports](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/network-ports/); ensure origin listens on same ports clients use

### Security and Operational Risks When Bypassing Cloudflare

**Immediate Loss of Protections**:

- [WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/), [rate limiting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/), [bot management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/), [DDoS mitigation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/) no longer active
- Origin IPs exposed to scanning and direct attack if previously hidden
- Review and update origin firewall rules, fail2ban configurations, and ACLs

**Capacity Concerns**:

- Predictable surge in traffic and connections
- Monitor resource usage and enable autoscaling if available
- Consider [connection limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/security/protect-your-origin-server/) at origin

**Observability**:

- Ensure direct-to-origin logs are collected
- Adjust alerting thresholds for increased baseline traffic

### Pre-Incident Preparedness Checklist

Implement these measures before an outage occurs:

✅ **Disaster Runbook**: Document exact API calls and operator steps to toggle proxied flags and update DNS records. Keep [API tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) secure and accessible.

✅ **DNS Resilience**:

- Maintain low TTLs (60–300s) for critical records
- Configure tested [secondary DNS provider](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/) with pre-staged records

✅ **Origin TLS**:

- Deploy publicly valid TLS certificates with automated renewal
- Keep [Cloudflare Origin CA certs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/) only if you also maintain public CA cert for failover

✅ **Origin DDoS Protections**:

- Implement network ACLs, upstream scrubbing, provider mitigations as fallback
- Use [iptables](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/cloudflare-ip-addresses/#configure-origin-server) to allowlist only Cloudflare IPs normally, but have rules ready to open during bypass

✅ **Health-Check Driven Failover**:

- Use DNS provider supporting [active/passive failover](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/health-details/)
- Test failover quarterly / periodically

✅ **Multi-CDN Architecture** (for extreme requirements):

- Consider active-passive or active-active with traffic steering at DNS or load balancer layer
- Review [multi-vendor reference architecture](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/architectures/multi-vendor/)

### Rollback and Verification After Cloudflare Recovery

**Re-Enable Protections**:

1. Verify Cloudflare services healthy via [Status page](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/) and test requests
2. Re-enable proxying (`proxied: true`) for records previously disabled
3. Or re-point authoritative DNS back to Cloudflare if NS records were changed
4. Re-verify [origin security rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/security/protect-your-origin-server/) to allow Cloudflare

**Validation**:

- Test TLS termination, WAF rules, bot management features
- Review origin access logs and [Cloudflare Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/) and [Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/types-of-analytics/) to confirm traffic routing normalized
- Verify security features (rate limiting, firewall rules) are active

**Post-Incident Review**:

- Document actual time to failover vs. RTO targets
- Identify gaps in security, runbook or tooling
- Update incident response procedures with lessons learned

### Summary: Technical Tradeoffs

| Mitigation Strategy                    | Speed                  | Requirements                 | Risks                                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Toggle proxy off via API/Dashboard** | Fastest (seconds)      | Cloudflare API reachable     | Removes L7 protections, exposes origins                   |
| **Change DNS to origin**               | Medium (TTL dependent) | External DNS control         | Propagation delay, requires pre-planning, exposes origins |
| **Switch authoritative NS**            | Slowest (likely hours) | Pre-configured secondary DNS | Long propagation, manual registrar changes                |

**Key Insight**: Preparation (low TTLs, secondary DNS, origin certs, autoscaling, origin security controls) reduces impact and decreases time to recovery. The fastest mitigations require the most preparation.

## Summary: Operational Discipline

Resilience is not a one-time setup but an ongoing discipline.

### Resilience Hierarchy

Prioritize resilience strategies in this order:

1. **Cloudflare Native Resilience (Primary)**: Load Balancing, health checks, multiple origins, [Workers / Snippets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/snippets/when-to-use/)-based failover, [Custom Errors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/custom-errors/).

2. **Multi-Vendor DNS (Secondary)**: External authoritative DNS with [Cloudflare as Secondary](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/zone-transfers/cloudflare-as-secondary/), or [Partial (CNAME) setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/partial-setup/).

3. **[Multi-Vendor](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/architectures/multi-vendor/) Security Proxy (Tertiary)**: Only for extreme compliance requirements; introduces significant operational overhead.

### Key Principles

1. **Own Your Control Points**: Unfettered, secure access to Domain Registrar and MDM platform is non-negotiable, following a [principle of least privilege](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/manage-members/).

2. **Infrastructure as Code**: Manage all configurations via API / [Terraform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/terraform/). Enable rapid, audited, transferable changes. Prevent self-inflicted outages.

3. **Secure Origins for Bypass**: Ensure origins have publicly trusted SSL certificates and robust security posture (i.e. using [`iptables`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/cloudflare-ip-addresses/#configure-origin-server)) independent of Cloudflare protections.

4. **Monitor Externally**: Gain unbiased view of service health from user perspective.

5. **Test Playbooks**: An untested incident response plan is just a paper. Regularly test "break glass" scenarios on non-production / staging subdomains.

6. **Accept the Trade-off**: For most organizations, the security risk of circumventing Cloudflare exceeds the cost of temporary service degradation. Design for this reality.

7. **Configuration Hygiene**: Rigorous change management with approval workflows, staging environment testing, and rollback plans prevents self-inflicted incidents.

### Recommended Artifacts

- Documented runbooks with step-by-step failover procedures for all involved teams.
- Terraform / IaC templates for "Emergency Bypass" configurations, applying the principle of least privilege.
- Pre-staged DNS records (inactive) for rapid failover.
- "Shadow VPN" infrastructure (dormant) for Zero Trust contingency.
- Company-wide communication plans and escalation paths.
- Periodic live failover exercises (not just tabletop): Simulate vendor failures in controlled environments, measure actual traffic rerouting times, and refine response processes under realistic conditions.
- Post-incident review (iteration) process including:
  - What protections were bypassed (WAF, bot management, geo-blocking, etc.) and duration
  - Emergency DNS / routing changes made and approval chains
  - Shadow IT emergence (personal devices, home networks, unsanctioned SaaS)
  - Temporary services stood up _"just for now"_ that became permanent
  - Documented unwinding plan for emergency changes
  - Intentional fallback plan for next incident vs. decentralized improvisation (continuous improvement)
