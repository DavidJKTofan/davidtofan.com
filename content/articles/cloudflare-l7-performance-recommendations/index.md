This guide provides non-exhaustive recommendations and general best practices for building a comprehensive Layer 7 (L7) Application Performance strategy **for your website / web application** with Cloudflare. It outlines how to leverage Cloudflare's performance and resiliency solutions and features to optimize web delivery, reduce latency, and improve [Core Web Vitals (CWV)](https://web.dev/performance#core-web-vitals) metrics – primarily relevant for Chromium browsers.

> [Measuring performance is tricky](https://blog.cloudflare.com/loving-performance-measurements/).

## Common Performance Goals

Aligning technical goals with business outcomes ensures optimisation work improves User Experience (UX) and Return On Investment (ROI).

Technical goals:

- Low Time To First Byte (TTFB)
- High cache hit ratio
- Improved Core Web Vitals (CWV)

Translating these into business impact:

- **Better performance / lower latency** → Improved UX and higher conversion rates

- **Reduced origin load and bandwidth** → Lower infrastructure and maintenance costs

- **Ensured availability / uptime** → Business resiliency, positive reputation, better UX

## Key Performance Metrics

Measuring the right metrics reveals which issues affect real users and guides effective remediation.

Effective optimization starts with measuring the _right_ things – which interestingly is slightly different for everyone. Nonetheless, most people would agree to focus on user-centric metrics for website performance, using [TTFB as a diagnostic tool](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ttfb-is-not-what-it-used-to-be/) for server responsiveness, but prioritizing Core Web Vitals for measuring user experience.

| **METRIC**                          | **WHAT IT MEASURES**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **TARGET (75th Percentile)** |     |     |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --- | --- |
| **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**  | Measures loading performance. Marks the point when the largest image or text block in the viewport becomes visible. When optimizing LCP, it's helpful to try to optimize these subparts individually: TTFB (HTML Document), Resource Load Delay (Stylesheet CSS), Resource Load Duration (Images + Scripts), Element Render Delay (Scripts). | LCP < 2.5 seconds            |     |     |
| **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)** | Measures interactivity. Assesses the overall responsiveness of the page to user clicks, taps, and keyboard inputs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | INP < 200 ms                 |     |     |
| **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**   | Measures visual stability. Quantifies how much unexpected layout shifts affect the user experience as the page loads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | CLS < 0.1 score              |     |     |
| **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**       | Measures server responsiveness. It's the time between the client/eyeball request and the arrival of the first byte of the (Cloudflare) server response. A high TTFB will always lead to a poor LCP, but a good TTFB doesn't guarantee a good LCP.                                                                                            | TTFB < 800 ms                |     |     |
| **Time to Last Byte (TTLB)**        | Measures the time it takes until the last byte of a resource is received.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | TTLB < 1.5 seconds           |     |     |

### User (Eyeball Client)

The user's connection is the baseline for every performance metric. Network quality, device hardware, and geographic distance determine initial load times and responsiveness. Because device and network variability dominate perceived speed, fixing issues at this layer delivers the largest and most immediate UX improvements.

Many variables affect performance at the user connection stage: device hardware (and age), operating system (OS), CPU/RAM capacity, browser, location, Internet Service Provider (ISP), and more.

The user's [proxied](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/proxy-status/) request typically lands at the [closest Cloudflare Point of Presence (PoP)](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) via [anycast](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/). This is where Cloudflare's [peering and network interconnects](https://bgp.he.net/report/exchanges#_participants) is relevant.

Some of the Cloudflare-related features that could potentially improve some of the relevant metrics are:

This hinting, when the response contains link headers with `preconnect` or `preload` `rel` types, speeds up page load times and generally [reduces user-perceived latency](https://blog.cloudflare.com/early-hints/). <br>Use `preload` with surgical precision – only for resources not in HTML like fonts, dynamic LCP images, or JS imports. For images in HTML, combine `preload` with `fetchpriority="high"`. Use `preconnect` for 1-2 critical third-party domains; use `dns-prefetch` for less critical domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Cloudflare Edge (Tiered Cache / Storage)

Advanced caching topologies and persistent edge storage create hierarchical cache layers and long-term content availability, cutting origin calls and raising global delivery efficiency. Tiered caching and edge storage handle infrequent requests at the edge, lowering load and cost. These same patterns allow fully serverless, originless architectures where logic and data reside entirely at the edge, eliminating the origin from the critical path and reducing latency to the minimum possible path.

| **Tiered Caching**          | Cache Hit Ratio, TTFB, LCP, Origin Load | Leverage a **[Tiered Caching Topology](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/)** to ensure that assets are served from a hierarchy of Cloudflare PoPs, increasing [Cache Hit Ratio](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/performance-review/cache-analytics/), reducing latency, potentially saving bandwidth and load on the origin server, and improving response times for users (since optimally there's no additional network hop to the origin). Smart Tiered Caching is normally the recommended option.                                                          |
| **Cache Reserve**           | Cache Hit Ratio, TTFB, Origin Load      | Since Cloudflare's CDN is based on the algorithm [Least Recently Used (LRU)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/concepts/retention-vs-freshness/), enable [Cache Reserve](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/advanced-configuration/cache-reserve/) to serve less-frequently requested content from Cloudflare's global storage, due to a retention period of 30 days, ensuring better content availability, increased Cache Hit Ratio, and reduced origin server load. It is recommended to use Cache Reserve in combination with Tiered Caching, as part of a wider caching topology. |
| **Connection Reuse**        | TTFB, Origin Load                       | Taking advantage of HTTP/2, requests from Cloudflare can use the same connection – [connection reuse](https://developers.cloudflare.com/smart-shield/concepts/connection-reuse/) – even if they are for different domains, reducing the number of connections – TCP and TLS handshakes – improving overall performance and reducing the load to the origin server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Cloud Connector Rules**   | TTFB, Origin Load (routing efficiency)  | Simplify cloud routing and object storage configurations by routing matching incoming traffic from your website to a public cloud provider that you define with [Cloud Connector Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/cloud-connector/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Data or Storage Options** | TTFB, LCP, Origin Load, Cost            | Store assets or data in different [data or storage options](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/storage-options/), such as **[Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/how-r2-works/)**, a distributed object storage solution, offering [faster retrieval](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/how-r2-works/#performance) and potential cost savings. Depending on your use case, different options are available.                                                                                                                                                    |

### Origin Server

While edge optimization handles most traffic, the origin path still determines the speed of cache misses, dynamic logic, and API execution. A tuned origin connection and infrastructure keep latency steady, maintain availability, and sustain throughput for content that cannot be or was not cached. Tightening this layer lifts every downstream metric and prevents degradation under load.

> There's the alternative option of going serverless / originless by building and hosting directly on Cloudflare's [Developer Platform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/workers/devplat/intro-to-devplat/), such as Workers [Static Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/) or [Frameworks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/). Here's an example of [fullstack applications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/fullstack-application/).

| **Load Balancing**                            | TTFB, Availability, Origin Load | Implement effective [load balancing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/understand-basics/proxy-modes/) to distribute traffic evenly across multiple origin servers / endpoints, ensuring high availability and reliability.                                          |
| **Dedicated CDN egress IP addresses (Aegis)** | Security, Availability          | [Dedicated CDN egress IP addresses (Aegis)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/aegis/) for IP allowlisting on the origin server. This is one of several [options to protect the origin server](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/security/protect-your-origin-server/). |

> An alternative to Load Balancing is [Round-Robin DNS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/round-robin-dns/), a simpler approach that randomly distributes traffic across multiple servers based on DNS records.

## Monitoring & Testing Tools

Continuous monitoring and testing verify each optimization and expose new gaps. Measurement and logging confirm real gains, surface regressions early, and reveal edge cases long before they affect users.

For more detailed investigations within Cloudflare, review [Cache Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/performance-review/cache-analytics/), [Instant Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/instant-logs/), [GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/), [Log Explorer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/log-explorer/), or [Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/).

> In the GraphQL Analytics API dataset [`httpRequestsAdaptiveGroups`](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-timing-insights/), look for relevant fields, such as `edgeTimeToFirstByteMs`, `edgeDnsResponseTimeMs`, `originResponseDurationMs`.

> In Log Explorer and Logpush check for relevant [HTTP request fields](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/datasets/zone/http_requests/), such as `EdgeTimeToFirstByteMs`, `CacheCacheStatus`, `CacheTieredFill`, `ClientTCPRTTMs`, `OriginDNSResponseTimeMs`, `OriginResponseDurationMs`, and `OriginTCPHandshakeDurationMs`.
