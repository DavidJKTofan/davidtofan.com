## Tenant-Aware Security for SaaS and Platform Providers

Modern SaaS and platform ecosystems rely on multi-tenant architectures â€“ single infrastructures serving many distinct customers. This design maximizes scalability and efficiency but also centralizes risk: one vulnerability can impact all tenants. A tenant-based security strategy isolates risks, enforces per-customer policy, and maintains predictable control across layers of the stack.

This blueprint defines a practical Cloudflare-based approach to [multitenant](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-multitenancy/) security framework.

## 1. Foundational Layer: Account-Wide / Global Controls

All platforms begin with shared baseline controls. These global defenses must protect every tenant (user or customer) equally.

**Recommended Controls:**

- **[Account-level WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/):** Apply managed and custom rulesets at the account layer for consistent protection across all zones and domains.

- **Global Rate Limiting:** Mitigate volumetric or brute-force attacks at the edge before they reach origin.

- **Gateway DNS Policies:** Apply DNS and egress filtering for [Managed Service Providers (MSPs)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/managed-service-providers/) and platform operators.

These global measures define the shared defense surface, ensuring platform-wide protection regardless of tenant segmentation.

## 2. Tenant Isolation at Application Layer

SaaS applications vary in exposure and tenant structure, some examples include: custom hostnames, APIs, user identity tokens, and subscription tiers. Granular enforcement becomes mandatory.

### No Predefined Tenant Identifiers

**Example scenario:** When tenants share a **common endpoint (e.g., `api.saas.com`)**, identifiers must be set based on specific logic or derived dynamically.

If tenants are not clearly identified by default, establish identifiers through the following methods:

- **Hostname Group [Lists](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/#availability):** Group hostnames (via request host header [`http.host`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/http.host/)) by subscription tier (i.e. `free`). For example, a list named `free_tier_hostname_group` may include `customer1.saas.com` and `customer2.saas.com`.
- **[Transform Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/):** Append tenant-specific identifiers as query strings (`?tenant=enterprise`) or response headers (`X-Customer-Tier: enterprise`) using supported [filter expressions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/transform/url-rewrite/reference/fields-functions/). Refer to the [phases list](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/) to ensure proper rule execution order.
- **Rate Limiting by Header Value Of:** Apply rate limits based on a shared request header such as `api-key`, using the [characteristics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/parameters/#with-the-same-characteristics) parameter.
- **Rate Limiting by Response Header:** [Increment counters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/parameters/#increment-counter-when) based on response headers (e.g., `X-Tenant-ID: TenantID#1234`), added by origin server / backend logic.

### Vanity / Custom Hostnames as Tenant-Identifier

**Example scenario:**

- Hostname: `customer1.saas.com` / `saas.customer1.com` (vanity domain pointing to the SaaS provider)
- Custom Metadata: `"custom_metadata": { "customer_id": "12345", "redirect_to_https": true, "security_tag": "low", "tier": "free" }`
- Related Case Study: [Shopify](https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/shopify/)

Using **[Cloudflare for SaaS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/)**:

- Use the request host header [**`http.host`**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/http.host/) as a tenant signal in WAF and rate-limiting expressions.

![Cloudflare for SaaS WAF Hostname](img/saas-waf-host-header.png)

```bash
curl https://customer2.cf-saas.com
```

- Attach per-tenant [**Custom Metadata**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/domain-support/custom-metadata/) to custom hostnames, then reference metadata in expressions for tier-based or customer-specific logic:

```
lookup_json_string(cf.hostname.metadata, "tier") eq "enterprise"
```

![Cloudflare for SaaS WAF Custom Metadata](img/saas-waf-custom-metadata.png)

```bash
curl https://customer1.cf-saas.com
```

> Custom Metadata is evaluated before the WAF [phase](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/), making it the only viable option for attaching metadata that can be directly consumed by security rules.

### JWT-Based Controls

**Example scenario:**

- Hostname: `api.saas.com` (general shared endpoint)
- Request Header: `Authorization: Bearer wyJhbGc...` (includes JWT claims from the [JSON Web Key (JWK)](https://mkjwk.org/))

Authenticate and segment API users using JSON Web Token (JWT) claims:

- **API Shield [JWT Validation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/jwt-validation/):** Validate tokens directly at the edge. For custom validation logic, use [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/jwt-validation/jwt-worker/) or lightweight [Snippets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/snippets/examples/jwt-validation/).

![API JWT Validation Rule](img/api-jwt-validation-rule.png)

```bash
curl -I https://petstore.automatic-demo.com/api/v3/pet/findByStatus
```

- **Advanced Rate Limiting:** Enforce thresholds by [custom JWT claims](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/parameters/#requirements-for-using-claims-inside-a-json-web-token-jwt), such as `tenant_id` or `user_tier` claims.

![Advanced Rate Limiting JWT claim](img/advanced-rate-limit-jwt-claim.png)

- **[Transform Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/jwt-validation/transform-rules/)**: Forward claims (e.g., `tenant_id`) as HTTP headers to origin server / backend systems for additional validation or custom logic.

### Request Header or API-Key Identification

**Example scenario:**

- Hostname: `api.saas.com` (general shared endpoint)
- Common Request Header: `api-key`

When tenants are distinguished via request headers:

- Inspect [**request headers**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/?search-term=request&field-category=Headers) such as `X-Tenant-ID` or `X-User-ID` to apply selective WAF and rate-limiting policies.
- Configure rate limiting using the **[characteristics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/parameters/#with-the-same-characteristics) `Header Value Of`** `api-key` field for consistent per-tenant per-API-Key throttling.

![Advanced Rate Limiting Header Value Of API-KEY](img/advanced-rate-limit-request-header-api-key.png)

```bash
for i in {1..50}; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -H "api-key: something" -I "https://petstore.automatic-demo.com/api/v3/"
done
```

### Request Payload / Body

**Example scenario:**

- Hostname: `api.saas.com`
- Body: `{"identifier":"TenantID#123", "data1":"content_here"}`

When tenant identifiers are embedded in HTTP request body content ([**raw body**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/?field-category=Body)):

- Use [**`lookup_json_string`** ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/functions/#lookup_json_string) to extract tenant JSON fields for conditional matching:

```
lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "identifier") eq "TenantID#123"
```

- Additional body sources include [**`http.request.body.multipart`**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/http.request.body.multipart/) and [**`http.request.body.form`**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/rules-language/fields/reference/http.request.body.form/), useful for structured data submissions.

## 3. Tenant-Level Observability

Security enforcement is only as effective as its visibility. Observe tenant-specific behavior to maintain isolation and accountability.

- **[Security Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/) and [Security Events](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-events/):** Track attack vectors and request patterns, and depending on the identifier also per tenant.
- **[Log Explorer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/log-explorer/):** Query logs directly within the Cloudflare dashboard or create [custom dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/log-explorer/custom-dashboards/) by tenant.
- **[Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/) with [Custom Fields](https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/logpush/logpush-job/custom-fields/):** Export tenant identifiers or headers for correlation in external SIEM systems.
- **[GraphQL Analytics API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/):** Build dashboards filtered by hostname, metadata, or tenant ID for real-time insight.
- **[Custom Hostname Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/hostname-analytics/):** Available for Cloudflare for SaaS customers to monitor vanity domain usage.

Observability must match enforcement granularity. Always verify execution order using the [phases](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/reference/phases-list/) list.

## 4. Developer Platform (Customization)

Platform providers offering custom code execution environments for tenants must enforce strict sandboxing. Use **[Workers for Platforms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/) (WfP)** to isolate tenant workloads securely.

- **[Dynamic Dispatch Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/get-started/dynamic-dispatch/):** Routes requests to tenant [User Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/get-started/user-workers/), handles authentication, sanitizes responses.
- **[Outbound Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/workers-for-platforms/configuration/outbound-workers/):** Restrict and control outbound (egress) traffic to prevent data exfiltration.
- **[Rate Limiting API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/rate-limit/):** Enforce per-tenant or per-function throughput within Workers.
- **[Workers Analytics Engine](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/) (WAE):** Track tenant usage and detect anomalies. **[Alternative storage solutions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/storage-options/)** are available; one recommended one is [Cloudflare D1 SQLite database](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/platform/limits/), which supports _for millions to tens-of-millions of databases (or more) per account_.

> No tenant code executes without boundary isolation.

In terms of observability:
- [Workers Observability](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/), which includes metrics and analytics, [Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/), and more.
- Build your own with [Tail Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/tail-workers/) and/or [Workers Analytics Engine (WAE)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/).
- When using [Custom Domain / Routes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/), one also also benefits of the HTTP/S Application Services visibility.
