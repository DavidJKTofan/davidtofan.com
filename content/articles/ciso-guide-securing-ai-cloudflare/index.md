## Securing the AI Revolution: A CISO's Practical Guide with Cloudflare

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping our world. But as it enables new capabilities, it also introduces new threat surfaces, from model abuse to AI-powered phishing.

To stay ahead, CISOs must adopt a proactive, Zero Trust security posture. This guide focuses on practical strategies using Cloudflare's platform to address real AI-era risks.

### [Use Case 1: Discovering Shadow AI](#use-case-1-discovering-shadow-ai)

**The Problem:** Employees are using unsanctioned AI tools. This creates unmanaged risk and potential data leaks.

**The Solution:** Use [Cloudflare Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/) with [Shadow IT Discovery](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/insights/analytics/shadow-it-discovery/) to monitor SaaS and AI tool usage. Block unauthorized tools and set policies for approved ones.

### [Use Case 4: Controlling Access to Self-Hosted AI](#use-case-4-controlling-access-to-self-hosted-ai)

**The Problem:** Internal AI APIs need to be accessible only to authorized users or services / agents and one needs to prevent synthetic identity fraud (SIF).

**The Solution:** Implement Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) and authorization.

- Use [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) for identity-aware access control based on user, group, device posture, or geography.

![Access Policies with Identity Selectors and Device Posture](img/access-policies-identity-selectors-device-posture.png)

- For services or agents, use [Service Tokens](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/service-tokens/) or [MCP Authorization](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/model-context-protocol/authorization/).

![Access Policies with Service Tokens](img/access-policies-service-tokens.png)

### [Use Case 5: Auditing and Controlling AI Content Scrapers](#use-case-5-auditing-and-controlling-ai-content-scrapers)

**The Problem:** AI bots are crawling your website to train their models without permission. Review the [AI bot & crawler traffic insights](https://radar.cloudflare.com/ai-insights).

**The Solution:** Mitigate AI bots.

- Use [AI Audit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-audit/) to monitor crawler activity. Or configure [pay per crawl](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-pay-per-crawl/).

![AI Audit Metrics showing AI crawlers](img/ai-audit-metrics.png)

- Combine with [Enterprise Bot Management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/bot-management/) and the [WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/) to granularly block, challenge or allow bots based on business policy. Review the [Verified Bots Directory](https://radar.cloudflare.com/bots/directory) for details.

![WAF skips Verified Bots](img/waf-bot-management-allow-verified-bots.png)

### [Use Case 6: Preventing API Abuse and Cost Overruns](#use-case-6-preventing-api-abuse-and-cost-overruns)

**The Problem:** Self-hosted models are vulnerable to prompt spamming or excessive use, increasing token costs and infrastructure load.

**The Solution:** Limit operations and gain observability.

- Use [Advanced Rate Limiting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/#availability) with JWTs or JSON body fields.
- Leverage [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) for [cost observability](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/observability/costs/) and [caching](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/caching/) to reduce usage.

![AI Gateway caching similar prompts](img/ai-gateway-caching.png)

### [Use Case 7: Defending Against Model Denial-of-Service](#use-case-7-defending-against-model-denial-of-service)

**The Problem:** Malicious traffic can overwhelm your AI API, denying service to real users. Review the [application layer DDoS attacks distribution insights](https://radar.cloudflare.com/security/application-layer#application-layer-ddos-attacks-distribution).

**The Solution:** Use the [Cloudflare reverse proxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/concepts/how-cloudflare-works/).

- Always-on [DDoS Protection](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/about/attack-coverage/).
- [WAF](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/), [Rate Limiting](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/), and [Enterprise Bot Management](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/get-started/bot-management/) to block abnormal patterns.
- [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/) for traffic visibility and [request handling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/request-handling/).
