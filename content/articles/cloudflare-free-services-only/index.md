### Domain Registration with Cloudflare Registrar

**Cloudflare Registrar** offers domain registration at cost, with no markup, ensuring affordable and transparent pricing. This includes free WHOIS redaction services. For more details, check out the [developer documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/registrar/).

### Building and Deploying Full-Stack Applications

Once you have your domain, you’ll need a place to host your website or application. **[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)** allows you to host HTML, CSS, and JS files or JAMStack sites globally, ensuring your application is close to your users. Combine this with **[Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/)** to add server-side code and create full-stack applications.

Integrate your domain with the Pages project as a [Custom Domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/custom-domains/) to make your site live. Utilize [Web Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/web-analytics/) and **[Cloudflare Zaraz](https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/)** to manage and optimize third-party tools.

Explore the [Cloudflare Developer Platform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/products/?product-group=Developer+platform) for more exciting solutions with free tiers.

### Object Storage with Cloudflare R2

**Cloudflare R2** offers generous free tiers for object storage. According to the [pricing documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/), _"egressing directly from R2, including via the Workers API, S3 API, and r2.dev domains does not incur data transfer (egress) charges"_. Use the [Workers API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/workers/) and [S3 API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/) to manage assets like images and documents. For practical examples, see the [egress-free object storage in multi-cloud setups](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/storage/egress-free-storage-multi-cloud/) and explore [Presigned URLs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/presigned-urls/).
