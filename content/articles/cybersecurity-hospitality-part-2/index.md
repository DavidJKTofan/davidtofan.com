## Cybersecurity in Hospitality: Part 2

> _Continuation and reminder of the 2022 article [Cybersecurity in Hospitality](https://davidtofan.com/articles/cybersecurity-hospitality/)._

Hotels and hostels store vast amounts of guest data (personal details, payment information, booking records, and more). This makes them prime targets for cyberattacks.

Industry reports, including [Trustwave's 2025 analysis](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/hospitality-under-attack-new-trustwave-report-highlights-cybersecurity-challenges-in-2025/), warn that cybercriminals increasingly target hospitality networks to steal or ransom data. Both large hotel chains and small independent properties have fallen victim to ransomware, phishing, and credential theft.

The trend is clear: threats are rising, and guest trust is on the line. The industry must act decisively and proactively to protect its systems and reputation.

## Secure Your Website and Booking Platforms

Your website and booking platform are attack entry points. Ensure that all web traffic uses encryption (HTTPS, TLS 1.2+), deploy a modern Web Application Firewall (WAF), and use sophisticated Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) protection. A content delivery network (CDN) such as Cloudflare improves both performance and resilience, caching content close to guests while absorbing traffic spikes.

Keep all servers, Content Management Systems (CMS), and booking applications like Property Management Systems (PMS) fully updated. Most breaches exploit known vulnerabilities that timely patching would have prevented. Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all admin and booking logins. Strong, unique passwords plus a second factor (such as a hardware key like [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/products/)) drastically reduce account compromise risk.

In summary:

- **Regular Updates & Backups**: Schedule automatic updates or monthly maintenance for PMS and web platforms. Back up guest and financial databases to secure storage.

- **Web Application Firewall**: Use a managed WAF to block malicious traffic.

- **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Automate certificate renewal, enforce HTTPS, and use strong ciphers with TLS 1.2 or higher.

- **Performance**: A slow website frustrates guests and can lose bookings. A CDN improves both load time and attack resistance.

## Protect Booking Accounts and Sensitive Data

Front-desk staff and managers often use online portals (i.e. Booking, Expedia, Airbnb, etc.) and email accounts to manage reservations. These accounts are high-value targets.

- **Use strong, unique passwords** for each platform. Never reuse them across platforms.

- **Enable MFA** wherever possible – many booking platforms should support it.

- **Restrict user permissions**: only give front-desk staff the access they need (for example, a receptionist may not need the same account privileges as a manager), following the principle of least privilege.

- **Stay alert to phishing**: Attackers often send fake emails claiming to be from booking sites or suppliers, trying to steal login details or spread malware. Train staff to verify unexpected requests (e.g. a sudden "password reset" email) by calling the company directly or checking with the IT team (if there is one).

- **Report suspicious activity**: If you see strange charges, duplicate bookings, or unauthorized changes, report them immediately to the booking platform's support team. (For instance, Booking has a ["report a security issue" form](https://partner.booking.com/en-us/help/legal-security/security/report-security-issue) for account compromises.)

Basic account hygiene prevents most credential theft incidents.

## Data Privacy and Compliance

Hotels and hostels must comply with privacy laws such as GDPR (EU) and CCPA (California). This extends to websites, analytics, and marketing tools. Privacy-conscious services like [Cloudflare Zaraz](https://blog.cloudflare.com/keep-analytics-tracking-data-in-the-eu-cloudflare-zaraz/) and [Web Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/) help limit data exposure. Hosting fonts locally also reduces unnecessary third-party calls.

Additional priorities:

- **PCI DSS Compliance**: If processing credit cards directly, ensure full compliance. The simplest path is usually using a trusted payment gateway that handles PCI requirements. Review [Cloudflare's PCI DSS 4.0 mapping](https://assets.ctfassets.net/slt3lc6tev37/5ai8vMkFvIGtVVyKF8BgP7/7621567cec21251ac48fe5a1635bc4b2/PCI_DSS_4.0_Cloudflare_Technical_Compliance_Mapping.pdf) for more technical details.

- **Limit Third-Party Scripts**: Every widget or chatbot adds risk to leak data or be compromised. Audit them regularly and remove non-essential tools. [Cloudflare Zaraz](https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/) can help control what data is sent to those third-party scripts.

- **Cookies and Consent**: Use a clear cookie banner and privacy policy so guests know what data you collect and for what purposes.

> **AI crawlers** now scan large portions of the web, including hospitality sites. Use Cloudflare's [AI Crawl Control](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/) to decide whether to allow or block them, or simply gain visibility. See Cloudflare Radar for [insights into crawler activity](https://radar.cloudflare.com/ai-insights?industrySet=Travel) in the travel sector.

## Train Staff and Enforce Physical Security

Technology fails without human vigilance. Staff awareness remains the first defense.

Provide regular cybersecurity training to your staff (and yourself). Teach employees to spot phishing, avoid personal USB drives, and lock screens when unattended. Reinforce strict password and data handling practices.

Protect physical records and hardware as well. Secure guest documents, payment slips, and printed itineraries in locked storage. Shred outdated paperwork. Restrict access to server rooms and offices using keycards or locks. If cameras are installed, store footage securely.

## The Takeaway

Cyberattacks on hospitality businesses are now routine, and the costs – financial, reputational, operational – can be devastating. Yet most defenses are inexpensive and straightforward.

Implementing an affordable CDN and WAF (for example, [Cloudflare](https://davidtofan.com/articles/cloudflare-free-services-only/)), enforcing least-privilege access, and scheduling regular staff training can greatly harden your defenses. Stay current with patches, control access, and plan for incident response.

Security is not about paranoia – it's about preparedness. Protect guest data to protect your business. Be proactive!
