## Cloudflare Radar

The Cloudflare Radar shares insights on data and attack trends across the Cloudflare network.

_Each second, Cloudflare handles on average 18 million HTTP requests and 6 million DNS requests. With 1 billion unique IP addresses connecting to Cloudflare’s network we have one of the most representative views on Internet traffic worldwide._

_And by blocking 72 billion cyberthreats every day Cloudflare also has a unique position in understanding and mitigating Internet threats._ – Source: [Introducing Cloudflare Radar](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflare-radar/)

Meanwhile (as of August 2022), Cloudflare is blocking an average of 124 billion cyber threats per day.

Furthermore, since **Alexa Rankings** is no more, say hi to the [Cloudflare Radar Domain Rankings](https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-domain-rankings/), as well as the [Internet Outages Map](https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center).

### DDoS attack trends

Another interesting thing, every Quarter, Cloudflare releases a report on the latest [DDoS attack trends](https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports?q=DDoS).

### Verified Bots

Cloudflare published a more detailed list on [Verified Bots](https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/verified-bots) on Cloudflare Radar.

The data on the list is updated in real time, and we'll be able to see [Bot Tags](https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/cloudflare-bot-tags/), which provide more _detail about why Cloudflare assigned a bot score to a request_.

### ASN

Cloudflare opens up more data, specifically data about [Autonomous System Numbers (ASN)](https://blog.cloudflare.com/asn-on-radar/): _"a group of routable IP prefixes belonging to a single entity, and is one of the key building blocks of the Internet"_.

### Future Improvements

It would be great to see more data become available at some point in the future, as well as to be able to use that data via API – essentially an open / public API.

Stay tuned for updates!
