# Cyber Readiness Guide

Cloudflare and many other companies/organizations/groups offer a variety of guides which prescribe a defense-in-depth approach or/and general cybersecurity best practices.

If you work at a **company**: 
* Get in touch with your internal IT team or your management and ask what strategy and tools the company will/has implement/ed. 
* Share the Cloudflare and Best Practice Guides with them and figure out a plan, especially in terms of E-Mail security.

If you are an **entrepreneur/freelancer**: 
* Cloudflare offers generous [FREE plans](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/#overview) for websites, devices, servers, and more.
* Check out the resource database [World of Opportunities](https://davidtofan.com/projects/world-of-opportunities/) for inspiration, tools, and more.

If you want to **protect yourself** as an individual or your family: 
* Check out my blog post [Protect yourself from Phishing](https://davidtofan.com/articles/protect-against-phishing/).
* Stay properly informed and aware of the online tools you use, but keep calm and relax – too much screen time cannot be good.
