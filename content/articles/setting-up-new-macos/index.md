# Setting up your new macOS

I predominantly use Apple products, and when transitioning to a new device within the Apple ecosystem, such as a fresh new MacBook, I find myself in the routine task of reinstalling all the essential software and tools crucial for my projects and day to day.

This article serves as a general to-do list for my own reference during the setup of a new laptop. Moreover, it can be a valuable source of inspiration for fellow individuals aiming to establish a privacy-conscious developer environment, encompassing the essential and often indispensable tools.

## macOS Privacy & Security Settings

[Change Privacy & Security Advanced settings on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40595/mac).

Turn on [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh11785/mac).

Configure [firmware password](https://support.apple.com/en-au/102384).

Updating `brew`, `npm`, `nvm` and their packages:

```

## Private Browser

Install and use [Brave](https://brave.com/) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) â€“ whichever you feel safer with.

Review browser configurations.

Additionally, install and configure [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) Add-On on Firefox, or [Brave Shields](https://brave.com/shields/) on Brave.

## Encrypted DNS

Follow the guide on [connect to 1.1.1.1 using DoH clients](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/dns-over-https-client/#cloudflared).
