## Cloudflare Zaraz

Zaraz loads third-party tools in the cloud, away from browsers, improving speed, security, and privacy, giving you full control over third-party tools without (necessarily) changing any code on your website.

## Practical Examples

Several examples and best practices are described in the Zaraz Developer Docs in the [triggers and rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/reference/triggers/) section.

### Google Analytics 4

By going on the [Privacy](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/zaraz/settings) settings and toggling-on all those options, as well as toggling-on "Hide Originating IP Address" in the Tools' Settings of Google Analytics 4 itself ensures that you are taking a proactive approach towards privacy and some regulations and standards.

### Google Fonts

_The [Web Font Loader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader) is a JavaScript library that gives you more control over font loading than the Google Fonts API provides._

An example for a **Custom HTML** Tool Action with PageView Trigger to load **Google Fonts** is the following:
```
<script>
  console.log("Google Fonts injected via Zaraz!");

  WebFontConfig = {
      google: {
          families: ["Ubuntu", 
            "Lato:100,300,400,700,900", 
            "Montserrat:100,300&display=swap"],
      },
      loading: function() {
          console.log("Fonts are being loaded");
      },
      active: function() {
          console.log("Fonts have been rendered")
      }
  };

  (function() {
      var wf = document.createElement("script");
      wf.src = ("https:" == document.location.protocol ? "https" : "http") + "://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/webfont/1/webfont.js";
      wf.type = "text/javascript";
      wf.async = "true";
      var t = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
      t.parentNode.insertBefore(wf, t);
  })(); 
</script>
```

### Custom System Properties and Triggers

Setting the rule type `Match rule` with variable `{{ system.page.url.pathname }}`, match operation `Starts with`, and match string i.e. `/index`, allows a tool to be triggered on specific URL pathnames.

Check out all [Zaraz event and system properties](https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/reference/properties-reference/).

### Block Zaraz

In order to prevent Zaraz to be loaded on specific pages, one can use [Page Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/advanced/block-zaraz/).

Additionally, one can define [Blocking Triggers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/advanced/blocking-triggers/) to define when to _not_ start an action.

Alternatively, one can decide to turn off the [Auto-inject script](https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/reference/settings/#auto-inject-script) and only [load Zaraz manually](https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/advanced/load-zaraz-manually/) on specific sites by adding the following `<script>` tag to your header:
```
<html>
  <head>
    ...
    <script src="/cdn-cgi/zaraz/i.js" referrerpolicy="origin"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```
