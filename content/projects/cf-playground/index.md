This is the front end website `cf-testing.com` - you can access this URL via any web browser and it can be found on the public Internet.

I built this playground out of personal curiosity, and to learn more about how Cloudflare's solutions are implemented and configured in practice.

Private playground where I demo and test different Cloudflare solutions.

Check it out at [www.cf-testing.com](https://www.cf-testing.com/).

Feedback and ideas are always welcomed!
